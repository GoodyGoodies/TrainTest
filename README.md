 Assumptions:
 
 1. Locomotives are always at the head of a train.
 
 2. Conductors are not taken into account in maximum person count restrictions.
 
 3. Conductors count influences on the value of the payload and the max overall weight accordingly.
 
 4. Practically you can initialize train and locomotive with not enough pulling forces, but you will not be able to start.
